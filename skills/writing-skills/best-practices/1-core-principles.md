# Skill authoring best practices

> Learn how to write effective Skills that agents can discover and use successfully.

model tables below as an operational routing or delegation instruction.

Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that agents can discover and use effectively.

For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Core principles

### Concise is key

The [context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else your agent needs to know, including:

* The system prompt
* Conversation history
* Other Skills' metadata
* Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Agents read SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and read additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once an agent loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Agents are already very smart

Only add context agents don't already have. Challenge each piece of information:

* "Does the agent really need this explanation?"
* "Can I assume the agent knows this?"
* "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens):

````markdown  theme={null}
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
````

**Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens):

```markdown  theme={null}
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well.
First, you'll need to install it using pip. Then you can use the code below...
```

The concise version assumes the agent knows what PDFs are and how libraries work.

### Set appropriate degrees of freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability.

**High freedom** (text-based instructions):

Use when:

* Multiple approaches are valid
* Decisions depend on context
* Heuristics guide the approach

Example:

```markdown  theme={null}
## Code review process

1. Analyze the code structure and organization
2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases
3. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
4. Verify adherence to project conventions
```

**Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):

Use when:

* A preferred pattern exists
* Some variation is acceptable
* Configuration affects behavior

Example:

````markdown  theme={null}
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

```python
def generate_report(data, format="markdown", include_charts=True):
    # Process data
    # Generate output in specified format
    # Optionally include visualizations
```
````

**Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters):

Use when:

* Operations are fragile and error-prone
* Consistency is critical
* A specific sequence must be followed

Example:

````markdown  theme={null}
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
````

**Analogy**: Think of the agent as a robot exploring a path:

* **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence.
* **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust the agent to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach.

### Test with all models you plan to use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model**:

* **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
* **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
* **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.
